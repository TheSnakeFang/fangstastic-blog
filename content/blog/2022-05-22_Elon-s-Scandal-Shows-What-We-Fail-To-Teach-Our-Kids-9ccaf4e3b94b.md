I was not surprised when the news broke last week that Elon Musk had secretly [paid a flight attendant $250,000 through SpaceX](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-paid-250000-to-a-flight-attendant-who-accused-elon-musk-of-sexual-misconduct-2022-5) to settle a sexual misconduct claim.

On the contrary, I was even glad “Elongate” wasn’t worse — quite a cynical thought.

In the wake of #MeToo, Spacey, Epstein, and countless other stories, a “classic” harassment case involving exposure to a company employee with no minors involved are practically the best a PR team can hope for in this day and age.

Obviously, this isn’t a defense of Elon. He’s a narcissistic man-child, evident as early as 2018 when he [accused a British diver who helped rescue Thai children stuck in a cave of being a “pedo”](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/15/elon-musk-british-diver-thai-cave-rescue-pedo-twitter) after his assistance was turned down. One scroll through his Twitter cements this view.

However, I find it odd when people take this opportunity to criticize Elon’s skill in running a business. Whether one can separate art from the artist is a debate as old as art itself. Still, I would like to point out that Elon’s controversy is so newsworthy because he is successful at building wealth, brand, and company — if he were a failed businessman, no one would care.

Of course, it’s evident that outcomes like this are not desirable — Elon himself [spent considerable time on Twitter](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526997132858822658?s=20&t=ZnP5On5ifVzLwWcnVKAiHQ) spinning up claims about the upcoming “political attacks on me” from the “party of division and hate” before the article was released, suggesting that he at least deeply cares about the effect this case will have on his public image.

But why does this keep on happening? We see stars and notable personalities make crucial mistakes virtually every week. How could skilled or brilliant people in one aspect of life (a sport, an art, a field) be critically incompetent or even abusive in another (financial, interpersonal, emotional)?

Wouldn’t the people who have the most access to wealth and power be capable of hiring the necessary people and educating themselves, preventing these problems from occurring?

I’ve concluded that telling the successful to focus primarily on improving their strengths is wrong.

If we have a star basketball player who shoots well but is terrible at teamwork and has a messy personal life, what would you work on if you were asked to give them advice?

Would it be free throws?

They already know how to score when they have the ball better than anyone else — practicing their main strength provides only diminishing marginal returns. If this is so clear in sports, why do people not apply this mindset everywhere?

Of course, it’s easier said than done. If a set of skills or traits was the reason someone achieved their goals in the first place, why should it not be their primary focus? Telling a singer to spend all their time producing more hit singles is the logical follow-up advice to give.

However, I think neglect of the holistic is the fundamental failure of ultra-specialization. If all of life is turned into a trade school, wherein you learn and practice only what is directly relevant to your career, then basic competencies in other fields can be missed entirely.

A professor at my university who works with students highly proficient in advanced mathematics told me the following quote:

> “These kids already know how to teach themselves math. What they need now is communication and interpersonal skills.”

The students he works with have “cracked” math — they’re national competition winners, after all. He understands the most practical way to improve their odds is not to drill them on what they already can learn and practice themselves but address their shortcomings instead.

Even in STEM research, one often finds that the person who networks is proficient at writing grant proposals, and collaborates as a team is far more likely to achieve career success than a lone wolf.

What, then, can we take away from Elon’s case and that of countless other scandals and personal failings of those who supposedly have it all? Obviously, our blind spots and faux pas do not have to be anywhere close to the magnified failures of bankrupt athletes, accused stars, or despondent artists.

Nevertheless, some lessons still apply.

It’s easy to take a bleak view that all power corrupts and damages individuals and that people with wealth or fame inevitably abuse it or fall to pieces themselves. I choose to think that it is the lack of oversight and hyper-focusing on specific metrics that gives existing negative traits and impulses free rein and that this issue also to a lesser extent affects the rest of us.

Parents tend to focus on nurturing specific skills a child is good at — Little League if they show promise at baseball, band camp if it’s music instead. While nurturing interests is essential to development, more focus is needed on broad areas like self-regulation, empathy, and social skills. We need to teach youth that being good in one aspect of life does not give you a pass everywhere else.

Holistic education is needed, focusing not just on aspects relevant to one’s field of study but also on practical, interpersonal abilities. The rise of radicalization through the internet results from individuals lacking these abilities and finding a place online that teaches these skills and offers an accepting community, only to gradually indoctrinate their worldview on the individual (the [Alt-Right Pipeline](https://harvardpolitics.com/alt-right-pipeline/), for example).

In terms of systematic solutions, there are cases where incentives align. After decades of high-profile athletes going bankrupt after retirement, the NFL now [offers planning resources and mandatory financial advisors](https://nflpaweb.blob.core.windows.net/website/PDFs/financial-advisor-FAQs.pdf) for athletes. Mental health is a central focus for schools and universities, with increased need [following the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on students](https://jech.bmj.com/content/76/5/448).

The younger generation is [far more open to discussion about problems they face](https://www.verywellmind.com/why-gen-z-is-more-open-to-talking-about-their-mental-health-5104730) than in the past, and these issues have been brought to light more and more. I believe that with our joint efforts, further improvement will follow.

Mocking Elon is fun — it’s subconsciously gratifying to see people more successful than we have crippling personal flaws and scandals, especially if we disliked their past actions or personal views.

However, schadenfreude doesn’t address underlying issues. I like to think long-term — is there a way we can educate the next generation while incentivizing the current one to change? The suggestions I mentioned above could be one step, but it comes down to the basics: empathy, reform, self-awareness, oversight, and transparency.
