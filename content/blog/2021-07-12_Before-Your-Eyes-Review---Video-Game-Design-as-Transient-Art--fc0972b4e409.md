#### Games are supposed to be fun.

You play them for the excitement, the suspense, the lows of falling behind building up to the highs of finally winning it all.

So when I was a sobbing wreck at the end of _Before Your Eyes_, why did I enjoy it so much? Why is it, in my opinion, the video game best suited for this pandemic year and the most emotional game I’ve ever played?

_Before Your Eyes_ is a story-driven narrative game where each scene cuts to the next if you blink. At first, this control scheme may feel odd — won’t tying a semi-involuntary action to the skip button cause the viewer to miss key plot points when they blink accidentally?

But _Before Your Eyes_ plays into this mechanic, setting up suspenseful moments and cliffhangers whereby the player strains to keep their eyes open to be able to see just one more second, learn a new piece of information, or stay in a single moment a little bit longer.

As a society, we have become accustomed to the “playback effect,” where everything in the past can be revisited on a whim.

> _Love a movie you watched a few years back?_

> Netflix has it on stream.

> _Old book you loved but can’t find any copies of?_

> If Kindle doesn’t have it, Amazon and ThriftBooks do.

> _Don’t remember your cousin’s wedding?_

> Not only does your Photos app have it from every angle, but it’s even classified by faces so you can sort the ones with your ex out in advance.

When content becomes readily available, so easy to access, store, and sort, it abruptly loses our interest. Why read thick, dialectic novels, when SparkNotes summarizes their beliefs and themes in seconds?

Video games suffer the same fate, where dialogue is treated as a plot vehicle to exposition dump or move the protagonist between the areas where the action occurs. There’s no sense of value in the content, exemplified no better than by the recent glut of “infinite grind” games and media, where the goal is to repeat the same mind-numbing activities over and over (swipe or click) until your wallet is empty, the dopamine cycle crashes, and you switch to a different feedback loop.

_Before Your Eyes_ is different. Every scene is relevant to the story — no filler content, cutscenes to mash the “skip” button through. Each blink permanently removes your ability to learn a part of the plot (at least until you play through the game again). The story doesn’t waste your time, lasting around a hundred minutes long in total on a typical playthrough — which makes sense given the potential for eye strain from manual blinking.

I don’t think the plot needs to be any longer than it is — it’s about the ephemerality of life, after all.

_Note: Spoilers ahead. I highly recommend going into Before Your Eyes Blind, but I will try to keep the spoilers light for those who need a bit more convincing._

_Before Your Eyes_ stars Benjamin Brynn, who has died and gone to the afterlife. A Ferryman picks him up and tasks Benjamin with recounting his life’s story, as he will be judged by a Gatekeeper soon.

If the Ferryman can successfully convince this Gatekeeper to let Benjamin into paradise by spinning a grand tale of his life, the Ferryman will also receive his due reward. And so, we dive into Benjamin’s memories.

We start from the beginning, when Benjamin moves into a quaint seaside town with his parents, Richard and Elle. Each blink closes the curtains and skips the time forward, sometimes by only a few minutes — other times by as much as a few years. With bath toys and dinosaurs, the narrative is a bildungsroman featuring a young boy growing up with his close friend Chloe as he faces pressure to learn piano from his mother, who regrets not living up to her father’s expectations and projects it onto her prodigy son.

What makes this slice of life story so entertaining is the blinking mechanic, effortlessly interwoven into the fabric of the game. When my mother presented me with a collection of Bach in the car, the prompt to blink and choose “crumple” suddenly pops up, and whether by reflex, accident, or a subconscious desire to destroy the target of my suffering, I blinked before realizing what I had actually done. When most narrative games indirectly promote “save-scumming” and walkthrough guides to get “the best ending,” it’s a breath of fresh air to see a story that forces the player to embrace the randomness and volatility of real life.

In another scene, Benjamin had to pretend to be sleeping, so I closed my eyes to order to overhear his parents’ conversation. Rarely is a game so confident in their ability to keep a player hooked solely through dialogue that they let them take their eyes off the screen on purpose (and even close them entirely).

That immersion ([as brilliantly covered here by the developers themselves](https://www.inverse.com/gaming/before-your-eyes-interview)) is core to _Before Your Eyes_. When Benjamin sneaks out of the house to lie on the sand with Chloe and look out at the stars, knowing I could be sucked out at any moment with just a blink scared me. The feeling of loss, impermanence — though it was a fictional scene, the fear I had was real.

There is something wistful about cold nights we spend under the stars when we are young. Though I cannot fully relate to bitter adults whose childlike wonder and innocence have been gradually ground away by uncertain careers, stale relationships, bills & mortgages, declining health, and unfulfilled dreams, the childhood memories I do have are still fresh in my mind.

Lying on the grass or the playground with friends in the early hours of the morning, rambling on about life and love and the futures we all have ahead of us in run-on sentences much like this one — moments of vulnerability, wonder, smallness, framed in the tableau.

I have never seen a game capture quite that feeling as _Before Your Eyes_ does.

When I played through the first part of _Before Your Eyes_, I felt that Benjamin’s life after beginning his painting career was rushed and strangely dissimilar to reality, in contrast to the accuracy with which it portrayed childhood development and spousal relations.

Safe to say, I was clueless about the twist before it happened.

Somehow, I had this belief that video games must have happy endings. Even if the protagonist meets their demise at the end of their journey, it is through heroic self-sacrifice to save their loved ones — or something to that extent.

The concept of an eleven-year-old wasting away to a slow death from illness was, in my mind, the type of literary misery restricted to non-fiction novels read in a humanities class — à la [Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181077.Sadako_and_the_Thousand_Paper_Cranes). It’s a bitter message, one that is ever more exigent in the time of a pandemic.

Being cooped up in one's house, having limited person-to-person interactions, living with the fear of losing a loved one to a deadly illness — these are emotions we have all recently felt, and it only contributes to the empathy we feel for Benjamin’s plight. Perhaps as an only child, a failed pianist, a long-time sufferer of lung illnesses, and an aspiring artist who chose to pursue a more lucrative field instead of my genuine passion, I feel in some ways personally connected to the specific feelings of inadequacy Benjamin had.

Lies about becoming a famous Avant-Garde painter invoke pity and sadness rather than anger — his desire for fame and achievement was not due to greed for wealth or power. All Benjamin wanted was to live up to his mother’s expectations, if not through piano, then another form of art. Perhaps he would have attained those highs, too, if not for the vicissitudes of fate.

When Elle gives her final narration of Benjamin’s life story, the whole essay is a tear-jerker, but the lines that specifically stuck with me were:

> “…he got sick and was forced to stay inside for an entire year. And in that year he began to worry that he hadn’t lived enough, so he made up a story, of the great life he thought he wanted to live, which only made him forget the great life he already had.”

Despite not being directly about the pandemic or quarantine, this covers the feelings of inadequacy I had perfectly. Two years have passed by in just a few blinks, and everyone on social media seemingly took the time to make friends, learn languages, make memories, advance their lives in some meaningful way while I was left behind.

I know the counterpoints, I’ve heard them enough — social media is fake, everyone is suffering deep inside, and all that jazz — but I’m still naïve enough to dream of the high heights I think I want to live in, and foolish enough to take for granted the great life I already have.

We try so desperately to change the world, but I suppose just being there for our friends and family in a time of great uncertainty can be everything we need to be.

I want to believe that.
