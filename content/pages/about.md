Hello, I'm Kevin.
‚Äç
Thank you for taking a look at my blog.

I'm a honors graduate of Carnegie Mellon University with majors in Computer Science and Business Administration.

Interests include lunar rover landing site viewshed analysis, ballroom dance, interior design, the color #7fc6b8, and spending 14 hours creating this stupid blog.

Currently GTM @ Replo (hi yuxin!). Also working on an idea for a pricing model for content creator partnerships with sponsors + auto-email negotiation.

If you want to chat, come on a podcast, or show me a JS framework that works, contact me at kevinfan@alumni.cmu.edu üöÄ
