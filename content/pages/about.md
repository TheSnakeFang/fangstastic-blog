Hello, I'm Kevin.
‚Äç
Thank you for taking a look at my blog.

I'm an undergrad student at Carnegie Mellon University currently studying Business Administration and Computer Science. Interests include lunar rover landing site viewshed analysis, ballroom dance, interior design, npm audit --force, #7fc6b8, and writing on topics I have no experience in.

If you like what I say and do, I'm currently looking for an internship in SWE/PM/Growth/anything exciting.
