Hello, I'm Kevin.
‚Äç
Thank you for taking a look at my blog.

I'm an undergrad student at Carnegie Mellon University currently studying Business Administration and Computer Science. 

Interests include lunar rover landing site viewshed analysis, ballroom dance, interior design, the color #7fc6b8, and spending 14 hours migrating my blog onto Medium instead of applying for jobs.

If you or someone you know may be interested, I'm currently looking for an internship in SWE/PM/Consulting/Growth/anything exciting for Summer 2023. 

Contact me at kevinfang@cmu.edu :rocket:
