Hello, I'm Kevin.
‚Äç
Thank you for taking a look at my blog.

I'm a honors graduate of Carnegie Mellon University with majors in Computer Science and Business Administration. Forgot everything I learned though.

Interests include lunar rover landing site viewshed analysis, ballroom dance, interior design, the color #7fc6b8, and spending 14 hours creating this stupid blog.

Currently GTM @ Replo (YC S21). Also working on an idea for a pricing model for content creator partnerships with sponsors + auto-email negotiation.

If you want to chat, come on a podcast, or show me AI that will actually take my job, contact me at me@kevinfang.tech üöÄ
