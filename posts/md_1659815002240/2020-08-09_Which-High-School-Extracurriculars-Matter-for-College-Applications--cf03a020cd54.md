It was my first day on my high school campus. Between the club booths on Orientation Day were crowds of eager children with parents in tow, pushing and shoving as they moved between the gym and the library (for the historians, this was a few years before social distancing). There were the usual suspects: Speech and Debate, Science Bowl, CSF, Music Boosters, Sports Teams. The one pitch they all gave to me?

> “Have you thought of going to a top university? If so, join us!”

I suppose you could call my high school competitive in terms of college admissions; the demographics were majority first-generation, Asian, middle-class — the group most likely to be swayed by college admissions claims of questionable veracity. I myself joined countless clubs in the desperate attempt to achieve my admissions goals.

#### So what clubs sound good to Admissions Officers?

The short answer, “It is what you make of it,” does sound like a cop-out, so that I will elaborate. As the advice I am about to give is subjective, take everything I say with a grain of salt.

What I am almost certain of is that “common” extracurriculars are boring.

> “I’m not saying you should not join CSF or NHS or Speech and Debate just because they are popular. However, if you are basing your entire application around Speech and Debate, and you’re applying to T20 colleges, perhaps 60% of applicants have tried Speech and Debate at some point in high school. You’d better have a vivid personal story, leadership position, or state and national awards of some kind to stand out — that’s the hard truth.”

The purpose of extracurriculars is to demonstrate your idiosyncracies outside of standardized test scores and GPA confines. Imagine college admission is a dating app, and your profile said:

> “Likes dogs, The Office, Netflix, and ice cream.”

Though none of the above elements are negative, they are commonplace. None will convince the admissions officer to accept you when they have already rejected three applications with similar stats that day. Swipe left.

#### Ah. So the answer is I have to have quirky extracurriculars?

Not exactly. If you are applying to Pre-Med, it’s nice to be part of a pre-med club or organization (though not required). Similarly, applicants to Computer Science with a few hackathons wins under their belt, or a loaded GitHub profile stands a better shot at convincing colleges that “this is what I want to do with my life.”

And that’s the key. Rather than superficial clubs and organizations which you care little about (or you chose specifically to get into college), pick a few which cover your interests and possible careers and dive deep.

> “Remember that your application is reviewed in context, and that we look to see what you did with the options available to you no matter where you live or attend school. Don’t be concerned about having a lot of extra’s — we’re really interested in the few things that excite and motivate you.” — [MIT Admissions FAQ](https://mitadmissions.org/help/faq/extracurriculars/)

Colleges want to know what makes you stay up at night and spend your free time grinding. Is it wondering how Gravitons could bypass the need for String Theory? Is it wrangling over lines from Ravel’s _Gaspard de la Nuit_? Is it teaching math and playing basketball with middle-school kids who don’t have a place to go after class ends?

**Key: You should enjoy what you do.** If your experiences with your extracurriculars could be described with boredom or antipathy, how are admissions officers supposed to feel?

You don’t have to be someone else — discover yourself, then be you. Listen little to the crowds telling you to “join this club to be admitted”; listen more to your own heart.

#### The final step: Putting it all together.

You have a selection of extracurriculars, all of which represent elements of your personality and interests you wish to tell colleges. How do we put them together? Honestly, it depends on a per-application basis, but they fall into 3 categories:

#### Community Service/Volunteer Work:

> Alamo Creek Clean, 2017–20. Founder, held monthly creek cleans. Averaged 40 students per event. Awarded service medal by city mayor.

It also includes environmentalism, religious work, and working with underprivileged groups. Shows empathy, wider worldview, strong morals.

#### Jobs/Experiences:

> Small Farm Beekeeping, 2018–20. Assistant on a local small farm, harvested over 30 pounds of honey every season. Pay goes to college fund.

Includes internships paid and non-paid, along with summer camps and workshops. Shows commitment, maturity, practicality.

#### Competition:

> Future Science Bowl Debaters of America, 2017–20. Nats finalist (environ. policy), state champion four times. School FSBDA president, 18–20.

Sports teams, quiz bowls, any activity where teams or individuals win awards and accolades through competition. Shows prestige, success, dedication.

Order extracurriculars from most important (to who you are as a person) to least important, making sure not to list too many from one of the above sections together. Though admissions officers will likely skim through the list anyways, starting with four or five different service clubs in a row may bore them enough to move on.

#### Quick Warning: Do not make up an exaggerated social charity or nonprofit extracurricular for the sake of getting into college.

I cover specifically the downsides of a false Spike in my article “[_What Is A College Application ‘Spike’ And Should I Have One?_](https://medium.com/@fangdaddy/what-is-a-college-application-spike-and-should-i-have-one-b7e776e92f09)_”_ but suffice it to say high schoolers are inexperienced in duplicity; one alumni interview can poke a hole in the “COVID-19-Curing Nonprofit” which failed to raise any money or hold any meaningful events, no matter how many acronyms it hides behind.

Botany, beekeeping, or barbershop quartets (or any vaguely interesting hobby) interests admission officers far more than whatever junk students assume colleges are looking for anyways.

In conclusion, find out what you love and what represents you. Narrow your extracurriculars to a few which encompass these interests and join those clubs and organizations. If they don’t exist, even better: be a founder in your school or community. Don’t listen to your peers’ advice of “secret college acceptance clubs,” and don’t lie and exaggerate.

Take it from MIT.

Be honest, be open, be authentic — this is your opportunity to connect with us… if you’re thinking too much — spending a lot of time stressing or strategizing about what makes you ‘look best,’ as opposed to the answers that are honest and easy — you’re doing it wrong.”
