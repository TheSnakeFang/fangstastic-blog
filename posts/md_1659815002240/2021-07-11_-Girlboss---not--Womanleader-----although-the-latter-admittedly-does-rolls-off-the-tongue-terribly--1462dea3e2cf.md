"Girlboss," not "Womanleader" -- although the latter admittedly does rolls off the tongue terribly, the use of "girl" and "boss" both reinforce unhealthy ideas, the former condescending and the latter capitalistic. It reminds me of the parody quotes along the line of "girls can commit corporate fraud too".
