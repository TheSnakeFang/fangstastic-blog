I understand where you're coming from -- racial equality can only be achieved with the necessary social and financial investments in underrepresented areas.

The problem is, universities don't have the ability to pass legislation, remove redlining, or create social programs -- all they have is the tool to accept more students of one type or another (thus, affirmative action).

Higher education is one way to escape the cycle of poverty in the United States, but it shouldn't be the only way. However, given we are not able even to reform our healthcare system during a pandemic, the fight for reparations and other progressive ideals I fear will take many, many years.
