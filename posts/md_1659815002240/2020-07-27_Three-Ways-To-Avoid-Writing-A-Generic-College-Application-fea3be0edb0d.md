According to the internet, college admissions officers only select _unique_ applicants—colorful polymaths, who compose Latin sonnets and solve Math Olympiad problems between fencing rounds (or something along that line). A “generic” app is a death sentence, and applications should focus on being “quirky” above all else. In fact, some say, if you are a _boring_ ethnicity or gender for your major, you will be dismissed entirely.

Of course, this belief is untrue and dismissive towards minority students, who often struggled tooth and nail against systematic barriers to be admitted — only to hear from peers that they are successful only due to their race or sex. Bitter tirades from disaffected students notwithstanding, there is something to study from this discussion of genericism.

If you wish to skip straight to the advice, scroll down to the numbered list below. Otherwise, keep reading, and I will clear up a misconception; there is nothing wrong with being normal.

The average applicant hasn’t cured cancer or won a Nobel Peace Prize. Comparing people with the one or two “super unique and quirky applications” you read on the internet is, frankly, pretty toxic behavior. It is not your fault that your interests may lie in a competitive field, nor that your race, sex, or background may be more common among the applicant pool. What cannot be changed should not be focused on.

Few students are admitted into top colleges solely off of only one super creative essay or a single high test score. Essays, extracurriculars, different colleges, students applying to different programs in those colleges, majors, recommendation letters; there are countless ways to distinguish candidates from each other and make a stand on who you are and what you wish to do — that’s why colleges require all this in the first place. They pay AOs (admissions officers) to read mounds of additional texts. There is a purpose to the madness.

If colleges didn’t genuinely care about the students they admit, they would only ask one question: “What is your SAT score?” — and judge solely based on that. It would certainly save them time and money.

But enough digression. Let’s get into the advice.

1.**Avoid common phrases and pretentious words.** By common, I’m referring to vocabulary that exemplar essays and sample applications overuse. AOs read, let’s say, five applications minimum per hour. In an eight-hour workday, that’s perhaps at least forty per day? The twentieth time they read something along the lines of: _“I was born at a very young age, passionate to learn Computer Science,”_ they will suddenly develop an acute migraine and be unable to finish reading the application. Don’t copy the writing style, topic, or structure of an exemplar you see on the internet, especially if the essay is widely circulated. Even if only a few dozen other applicants think the same, it will still be immediately evident plagiarism — or at the very least lazy mimicry — is afoot.

For pretentious words and phrases, don’t write above your reading level. Imagine seeing on an application the sentence “_Though some of my efforts have been expended in the amelioration of banal diction, students instead choose to become sesquipedalians.”_ The AO upon reading questions their own life decisions which lead them to this point, and makes a mental note to reorder some more Advil.  
  
These examples are exaggerated, but hopefully, you get the point; word choice is key. Be concise, informative, and expressive. This advice applies to not only essays; you only get around 150 characters to describe each of your extracurriculars. Restriction forces students to brainstorm and problem-solve, meaning those rare applications that remain articulate and creative despite character limits can be pinpointed by readers.

2.**Have specific goals and plans for achieving those goals.** Applicants with a clear career path and personal story are humanized. Now I know not everyone has an _America’s Got Talent_ worthy story. So let’s switch gears— you can be unique through specialization. For example, focus on cybersecurity and data encryption instead of vague terms such as “coding.” Mention concrete terms — an applicant could mention how she worked with a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer during an internship at Kaiser Permanente and considered a career in it.

You don’t have to stand out by saying you’re applying to teach bees how to speak French _(Où est le miel?)._ Diversify a popular program; incorporate your specializations.

Having concrete goals rather than abstract ones grounds your application in reality and humanizes you. Vague statements about “passions” and “discovering potential avenues of study” does not.

3.**Participate in and include unique extracurriculars.** I’ll focus on specifically talking about selecting and listing extracurriculars in the context of making an application unique in this case. Extracurriculars themselves deserve a few separate articles — it’s complicated.

In short, if your entire class is in the same volunteering club, it will not make your application stand out compared to theirs. After all, if everyone in your grade had an identical GPA, it wouldn’t matter for comparison purposes anymore.

I’m not saying you shouldn’t join CSF or NHS or Speech and Debate just because they are popular. However, if you are basing your entire application around Speech and Debate, and you’re applying to T20 colleges, perhaps 30%+ of all their applicants have tried Speech and Debate at some point in high school. You’d better have a vivid personal story, leadership position, or state and national awards of some kind to stand out — that’s the hard truth.

If you are worried, order your common extracurriculars towards the end of your extracurricular list on your application. I would consider removing them altogether if you hung around club meetings and didn’t do much you could even write about.

So what instead?

There is the obvious. Instead of participating in a volunteer club, start and lead a volunteer club. Instead of competing in hackathons, organize and network sponsors to run your own. Organization requires leadership, initiative, and a whole lot of time and dedication — but that is why colleges appreciate them. If you can show hard results; money raised, recognition awards from local government, then that becomes something you can sell a central identity around. And no, I’m [not talking about a spike](https://medium.com/college-admissions-central/what-is-a-college-application-spike-and-should-i-have-one-b7e776e92f09).

To sum up the three points,

**One: Write without cliches and with consistency and style.** Try to sound interesting and not like a robot reciting bullet points.   
**Two: Make your goals specific and concrete.** Everyone applying to pre-med wants to work in the medical field; how many want to become anesthesiologists?  
**Three: Take the initiative to select ECs that stand out.** Try to join clubs that you find interesting outside of your intended major, or start your own to showcase leadership and diverse talents.

This does not mean that all three suggestions are requirements. It’s okay not to have founded any outstanding organizations or won national awards. Remember what I said initially; colleges ask for many parts of an application because they holistically review them — no one portion is a make-or-break scenario.

Often applications are generic because students have a false sense of what colleges are looking for, and they end up submitting applications that are pompous and stiff. They feel less like a real person wrote it and more like a cardboard cutout. Your goal is to add humanity.

Tell _your_ story.
